# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1: February 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
I created separate @media CSS files for phones and tablets/desktop. This is backend cleanup for the first live website I finished building a few weeks ago, www.jonilambtherapy.com.


Day 2: February 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Did some more CSS reorganizing for www.jonilambtherapy.com. Started building my HTML/CSS for a new website www.steadyarc.net (Steady Arc). Using three @media sizes for small phones, average to large phones and desktop to start.

Day 3: February 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Worked on HTML/CSS for Steady Arc website. Ongoing research to help inform my design by looking at five other Chicago property management websites on both desktop and phone.

**Thoughts**:
The design for my first site was very clear. The client needed something very straighforward and gave me great website examples to guide me. The property management websites I'm looking at for reference vary quite a bit and I'm struggling with the design. Will revisit tomorrow.


Day 4: February 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Added five anchor tags styled as buttons for various groups to link to per the client's request. Four of them go to a separate site I have a link for, and one goes to a new page for investors. Created the new investors page that the one "button" links to. Sent an email to the client with some questions that have come up.

**Thoughts**: 
Had an issue with adding a background color to the anchor tags. It wouldn't display. I did a bunch of Googling only to realize I had copied the color from a border which left "solid" in the CSS. Once I removed that the background color displayed.


Day 5: February 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Spent a few hours learning about and experimenting with CSS grid for my homepage layout.

**Thoughts**: 
CSS grid has a lot of pieces and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. I made progress but I still need to work on it some more. I think once I get it, it will be super helpful.


Day 6: February 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Spent time focusing only on experimenting with CSS grid to understand how it works. Had to work with hosting company customer support to fix email issue for client.

**Thoughts**:
When I hooked up client's GoDaddy site to SiteGround I did the same thing I had done for my first client's site. I only needed to change where the name servers pointed. Unfortunately, more was needed because the client also used a GoDaddy email associated with their domain name. This change caused their email communications to break so I had to work with SiteGround support to make some more changes to allow the email to work properly. Lesson learned: Make sure you ask your client about any products they use that are also connected with their domain name.


Day 7: February 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Didn't plan as much time to code today. Used the time continue learning CSS grid especially for overlapping divs.

**Thoughts**:
Kind of a discouraging coding time. Some days I just wonder how long it will take for me to understand certain things, especially being new to web dev and seeing how far I still have to go.
