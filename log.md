# 100 Days Of Code - Log

#### Day 1: February 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
I created separate @media CSS files for phones and tablets/desktop. This is backend cleanup for the first live website I finished building a few weeks ago, www.jonilambtherapy.com.<br><br>

  
#### Day 2: February 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Did some more CSS reorganizing for www.jonilambtherapy.com. Started building my HTML/CSS for a new website www.steadyarc.net (Steady Arc). Using three @media sizes for small phones, average to large phones and desktop to start.<br><br>

  
#### Day 3: February 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Worked on HTML/CSS for Steady Arc website. Ongoing research to help inform my design by looking at five other Chicago property management websites on both desktop and phone.

**Thoughts**:
The design for my first site was very clear. The client needed something very straighforward and gave me great website examples to guide me. The property management websites I'm looking at for reference vary quite a bit and I'm struggling with the design. Will revisit tomorrow.<br><br>

  
#### Day 4: February 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Added five anchor tags styled as buttons for various groups to link to per the client's request. Four of them go to a separate site I have a link for, and one goes to a new page for investors. Created the new investors page that the one "button" links to. Sent an email to the client with some questions that have come up.

**Thoughts**: 
Had an issue with adding a background color to the anchor tags. It wouldn't display. I did a bunch of Googling only to realize I had copied the color from a border which left "solid" in the CSS. Once I removed that the background color displayed.<br><br>

  
#### Day 5: February 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Spent a few hours learning about and experimenting with CSS grid for my homepage layout.

**Thoughts**: 
CSS grid has a lot of pieces and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. I made progress but I still need to work on it some more. I think once I get it, it will be super helpful.<br><br>

  
#### Day 6: February 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Spent time focusing only on experimenting with CSS grid to understand how it works. Had to work with hosting company customer support to fix email issue for client.

**Thoughts**:
When I hooked up client's GoDaddy site to SiteGround I did the same thing I had done for my first client's site. I only needed to change where the name servers pointed. Unfortunately, more was needed because the client also used a GoDaddy email associated with their domain name. This change caused their email communications to break so I had to work with SiteGround support to make some more changes to allow the email to work properly. Lesson learned: Make sure you ask your client about any products they use that are also connected with their domain name.<br><br>

  
#### Day 7: February 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Didn't plan as much time to code today. Used the time continue learning CSS grid especially for overlapping divs.

**Thoughts**:
Kind of a discouraging coding time. Some days I just wonder how long it will take for me to understand certain things, especially being new to web dev and seeing how far I still have to go.<br><br>


#### Day 8: February 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Decided to make the time to start working through the CSS grid Team Treehouse course.

**Thoughts**:
Grid is already starting to make better sense.<br><br>


#### Day 9: February 19, 2021
Continued working through the CSS grid Team Treehouse course.

**Thoughts**:
Okay, now I'm getting excited about grid and what it can do. I'm doing all of the quizzes and practice work to reinforce the concepts.<br><br>


#### Day 10: February 20, 2021
Worked through another section of the CSS grid Team Treehouse course.

**Thoughts**:
This is a great course and is really helping me to see how useful and time saving grid is going to be. I know how to refactor my first web dev project that I did with Chingu because of what I learned today with regard to auto-fit. I also have a better understanding of inline and block elements because I had to to figure out how to make my anchor tags stretch the width of the viewport for the Steady Arc site.<br><br>


#### Day 11: February 21, 2021
Based on my new understanding of CSS grid I sketched out the home page for my current website then I applied the concepts I'm learning in my CSS grid course by starting to rebuild it.

**Thoughts**:
I finally got of vision of what the page should like so I did a pen and paper sketch of it. I used the sketch to start rebuilding the Steady Arc homepage.<br><br>


#### Day 12: February 22, 2021
Continued to work on the rebuilding of the Steady Arc homepage. I decided on a design for small phones (<300px) and focused mostly on CSS changes for that size.

**Thoughts**:
Called a web dev friend for help on an issue I was having with CSS grid and my new layout and she told me about background-image. I tried to add it to my page but I didn't get the syntax right (yet!) so that was what pushed me to start working on the smallest version of site since it doesn't need an image, only the logo.<br><br>


#### Day 13: February 23, 2021
Continued working on the home page for small phones, which just needs a footer with contact info now, and started updating the desktop home page code.

**Thoughts**:
Had trouble with the image on my desktop homepage not resizing correctly, which still needs to be fixed, but I did use a nested grid to get it in the position I wanted it to be in.<br><br>


#### Day 14: February 24, 2021
Worked on figuring out the background image for my desktop homepage for Steady Arc. I finally got it working the way I needed it to and because that worked I also needed to chang some of the grid design I added earlier.

**Thoughts**:
It was an hour of wins. I successfully made my first commits using Visual Studio Code, the GitLens plug in and GitHub desktop. I got background image working.<br><br>


#### Day 15: February 25, 2021
Updated the CSS design on the Steady Arc desktop homepage again.

**Thoughts**:
I asked my husband, who has a graphic design background, for some design advice on my homepage. He provided some very helpful feedback that prompted me to redesign the CSS for the desktop homepage again.<br><br>

#### Day 16: February 26, 2021
Continued working on the CSS for the desktop homepage for Steady Arc.<br><br>

#### Day 17: February 27, 2021
Added my footer text and styled it. Did more work to CSS for Steady Arc desktop homepage.

**Thoughts**:
Just a little bit more tweaking and the desktop homepage with be complete and ready to show the client.<br><br>

#### Day 18: February 28, 2021
More CSS tweaks to header and footer and buttons.

**Thoughts**:
The background image is just huge so I cropped it multiple times to make it more manageable. Got the buttons positioned where I thought they would look good in the image whitespace on top but decided I'll going to make them vertical instead in the image whitespace to the left and see what I think.<br><br>

#### Day 19: March 1, 2021
Finished the desktop homepage and mobile design (300px or less) for Steady Arc and emailed screenshots of both to the client for feedback.

**Thoughts**:
My contract with my previous employer (Voyage Advisory) ended last Friday, February 26. So now that I am unemployed I get up at my normal work time and spend the whole day learning, writing code and networking. I was struggling with making the design look good. I swapped out a number of different Chicago background images and finally found a good match that scaled better and helped me figure out how to adjust the design so it finally looked nice. I was happy I was able to get something to the client today.<br><br>


#### Day 20: March 2, 2021
Worked on my media query for 301-600 pixels.

**Thoughts**:
Didn't code as much today because I also used the time to get my GitHub organized, among other things, to prepare for the promotional/networking side of my transition to web dev.<br><br>


#### Day 21: March 3, 2021
Got all of my responsive versions of the homepage completed.

**Thoughts**:
I added the files to SiteGround for initial BrowserStack testing which showed me some small items I need to fix. I let the client know he can look at the site online now. I am aware that testing should be done locally first, which I do, but I know the client hasn't advertised the site yet so I have some leeway.<br><br>


#### Day 22: March 4, 2021
Worked on refactoring my first website (www.jonilambtherapy.com) locally for both code readability and better design overall.

**Thoughts**:
I decided to refactor because my media queries are so confusing. I used only one CSS file instead of breaking out the queries by pixel groups. I also don't like what I did for the homepage image and quote and now that I have understanding of grid I can apply that and background image and make it work much better.<br><br>


#### Day 23: March 5, 2021
Continued working on local factoring of first website.

**Thoughts**:
Traveling, so only getting my minimum in today.<br><br>


#### Day 24: March 6, 2021
More local refactoring of first website.

**Thoughts**:
Traveling, so only getting my minimum in today.<br><br>


#### Day 25: March 7, 2021
Continued local refactoring of first website.

**Thoughts**:
Traveling, so only getting my minimum in today.<br><br>


#### Day 26: March 8, 2021
Got a ton of refactoring done for my first site.

**Thoughts**:
The code is better organized, incorporates CSS grid and is generally more readable.<br><br>


#### Day 27: March 9, 2021
Still more refactoring for my first site.

**Thoughts**:
Will be able to finish up tomorrow. Almost  there.<br><br>


#### Day 28: March 10, 2021
Finished the refactoring of my first site.

**Thoughts**:
Incorporated three different media queries so the site is more responsive for a range of mobile sizes.<br><br>


#### Day 29: March 11, 2021
Made some CSS changes to my first website before republishing.

**Thoughts**:
Made a few more CSS updates to www.jonilambtherapy.com after testing and republished on the hosting site.<br><br>


#### Day 30: March 12, 2021
Started learning JavaScript today by working through a Udemy web dev course section on JavaScript.

**Thoughts**:
I included this as my coding for the day because the instructor provides a lot of challenges and examples that we have to work through ourselves.<br><br>


#### Day 31: March 13, 2021
Continued through another chunk of my Udemy web dev course JavaScript section.

**Thoughts**:
Worked with functions, if/else and incrementing/decrementing, among other topics.<br><br>


#### Day 32: March 14, 2021
Finished the intro to JavaScript section of my Udemy web dev course.

**Thoughts**:
Worked with more complex functions and enjoyed the code challenges.<br><br>


#### Day 33: March 15, 2021
Started the intermediate JavaScript section of my Udemy web dev course.

**Thoughts**:
Continued working with functions combined with random and if/else statements.<br><br>


#### Day 34: March 16, 2021
Continued working on the intermediate JavaScript section of my Udemy web dev course.

**Thoughts**:
Worked with functions, if/else statements, arrays and slicing. Created a little leap year calculator.<br><br>


#### Day 35: March 17, 2021
More work on the intermediate JavaScript section of my Udemy web dev course.

**Thoughts**:
Wrote some functions for myself just to see how JavaScript would work including the FizzBuzz challenge. It was fun to play around. Learned when to use if, if, else vs if else, else statements, which I was curious about because the multiple ifs were making my code do unexpected things. I'm now two and half weeks into my unemployement and personal learning and I'm tired and feeling burnt out. My husband encouraged me to have more of a rest day today so I took care of myself during the day and had some nice hang time with him in the evening.<br><br>


#### Day 36: March 18, 2021
More intermediate JavaScript on Udemy.

**Thoughts**:
Wrote some if and while loop functions with incrementing and decrementing. Took my time to understand the concepts and how the code was running line by line using a cool code visualization tool I've used for Python but that works for other languages too. Also took a two hour JavaScript recursion course in the evening. My brain is tired.<br><br>


#### Day 37: March 19, 2021
More intermediate JavaScript on Udemy.

**Thoughts**:
Learned how to build a Fibonacci number generator. Not super productive. Ended up spending more time trying to figure out how to run my JavaScript code in Visual Studio Code using Node.js instead of just using the snippets in the Chrome developer tools.<br><br>


#### Day 38: March 20, 2021
Started my personal website!

**Thoughts**:
Created all the files for my personal site, www.katrinadurance.com. Reused the CSS resets from my last project and added in the css file references to my index.html. Had some issues getting it up on GitHub but I finally figured it out. I was hesitating to start my site because I wanted to build it using React.  I still have some vanilla JavaScript to learn before I feel ready to take on React, plus I reached out to a fellow developer for advice who told me I can always refactor later and then blog about that down the road.<br><br>


#### Day 39: March 21, 2021
Started building the homepage for my personal site.

**Thoughts**:
Started to learn about web fonts because I want to used some more interesting fonts outside of the common (and boring) web safe fonts. I found some I liked and downloaded them but I couldn't figure out how to get them to show up on the site yet and since I'm commiting to an hour only today I chose to move on to other stuff. I wanted to add a nice svg file to part of the page but had all sorts of issues getting the image I had coverted to svg but I finally did and got it working.I still have a lot to learn about working with images.<br><br>


#### Day 40: March 22, 2021
Learned more about grid, working with the Firefox font editor and working with images and CSS.

**Thoughts**:
Had some unexpected personal interruptions at home so I wasn't as productive as I would've liked. It was more of a learning day. Played a clever game to learn more about CSS grid and I learned some good stuff. I worked on tweaking an image I wanted to use for my personal homepage. I finally got it how I wanted it and where it was resizing correctly on my page. Watched a great video on using the font editor in the Firefox dev tools and played around with it myself.<br><br>


#### Day 41: March 23, 2021
Worked on my personal homepage. 

**Thoughts**:
Decided on a retrowave theme for my site. It's my era. I grew up in the eighties so it's not just trendy for me. Manipulated a vector (svg) image to crop it into a bunch of dividers for my blog posts. Used CSS grid to build the framework of the page.<br><br>


#### Day 42: March 24, 2021
Continued working on my personal homepage. 

**Thoughts**:
I learned that the Chrome and Firefox dev tools each have their own tools for checking how responsive your site design is so I won't need BrowserStack anymore. Design is no joke. I now understand why it's its own career field as I'm working on the aesthetics for my own site. I have all the images I need now so today I worked on my page layouts. Also learned how to make little pixel animations and stills using Piskel so I created a cool little vaporwave cube favicon for my site and added it to my code. Tried to get a ttf font added for my header text at the end of the day but it didn't render correctly so I'll need to troubleshoot that tomorrow.<br><br>
